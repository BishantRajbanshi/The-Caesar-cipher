This repository contains a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher in Python. The Caesar cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

# Features:
Encryption and Decryption:
  Easily encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar cipher algorithm.
Customizable Shift: 
  Choose the desired shift value to customize the encryption/decryption process.
Support for Alphabets: 
   Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters, maintaining the case of the input.
